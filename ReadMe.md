# **Portfolio Homework**

## **What did I do?**

In this homework I was told to create my own portfolio

I tried to follow a semantic HTML format, as well as work more within CSS.
I added Tags to the About me, Portfolio and Contact links on the top.
I added a about me section, portfolio section and then a Contact me section.

## ***Challenges?***

The Challenge was having the differnt portfolio pieces show seperately in a grid
I had a bit of trouble and wasn't able to finish it.

## ***Changes for the future?***

In the future I'd like to finish the style, but make it so the different pages had it so there was title for work, then as hovered over, it shows a brief discription.
